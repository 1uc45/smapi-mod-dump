This repository has the latest releases for all known SMAPI mods (as of SMAPI 2.8-beta.3 and
Stardew Valley 1.3.29 beta), used to update the [SMAPI compatibility list](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:SMAPI_compatibility).
The mods are grouped into these categories:

category       | description
-------------- | -----------
abandoned      | Mods which are obsolete, or have been abandoned by their authors and probably won't be updated unofficially. These will likely never be updated again.
broken in \*   | Mods which broke in a specific game version.
okay           | Mods which work fine in the latest versions (and don't fit one of the next two categories).
okay (Harmony) | Mods which work fine in the latest versions, and use Harmony to patch the game code. Using many Harmony mods together often causes conflicts, so these are separate for testing.
okay (Pong)    | The [Pong mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1994). This overrides the entire game, so it's separate for testing.
