In order to install, drag the folder containing these files into your Stardew Valley > Mods folder.

If you do not have a Mods folder, make sure you have SMAPI (Stardew Valley Mod API) installed:
1)	Go to https://canimod.com
2)	Singleplayer:
		Download the current version of SMAPI (but not the beta).
	Multiplayer:
		Download the current BETA version of SMAPI, as the beta is tied to Stardew Valley's Multiplayer Beta.
3)	Upon the download finishing, double-click "install.exe" to install, then follow the command prompt's instructions.

To change the stamina threshold at which the player automatically eats:
1)	Go to the "config.json" file and changing StaminaThreshold's value from 0.0 to an amount you desire.
2)	Alternatively, you may change it via the console, with the command "player_setstaminathreshold <value>", with "value" being a float/integer value.
