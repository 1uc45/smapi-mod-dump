<h2 id="installing">Installing</h2>

<p>Just unpack the .zip file in the mods folder.</p>

<h2 id="uninstalling">Uninstalling</h2>

<p>Just delete the mod files again.
The chests will remain &#8220;named&#8221; though, but the tooltip won&#8217;t work, if you want to undo the names, you can remove and put back down the chest, or edit the name back to &#8220;Chest&#8221; before uninstalling the mod.</p>
