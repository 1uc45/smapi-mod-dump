       Unify solution & minor cleanup (#5)
       
       * unify projects into one solution
       
       * migrate to new package reference format
       
       * remove manual deploy tasks
       
       Deploying to the mod folder is automated by the mod build package now.
       
       * migrate to Harmony NuGet package
       
       * fix hardcoded assembly path
       
       * migrate to PyTK NuGet package
       
       * update mod build config package
