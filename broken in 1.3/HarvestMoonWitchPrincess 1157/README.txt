	   INSTALLATION

---------------------------------------

The zip file contains a folder named "Content".
1. Back up your original files!
2. Extract the "Content" folder from the zip into your `Stardew Valley` folder.

Drag and drop the folder "WitchPrincess" into your mod folder.
Drag and drop the folder "Portraiture" into your mod folder.

To use Portraiture just talk with someone and press "P"
until you see that it shows the Portrait from "Witch Princess"


          !!!WARNING!!!
--------------------------------------
THIS MOD REPLACES SEVERAL FILES.
BACK UP YOUR XNB FILES BEFORE INSTALLING!
ALWAYS back up your old files! I am not responsible for any loss in original files!


I recommend making a folder called "BU" or "Backups" and putting the
original files into that folder.

You can copy and paste them entirely, then move them back if you'd like
the original files back.
