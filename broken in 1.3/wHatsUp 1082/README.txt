wHats Up

You know you look great with that hat. It is as if you feel you can do something extra today...

For Stardew Valley 1.2 (Steam beta only): use SMAPI 1.10 beta.

Vanilla hats give you a buff.

Update 1.1.2

- Fixed a null reference

Known issues:

- Buff Hovertext not always showing.
- No hovertext at hat.
- Drink with buff overwrite Hat Buff (Hat Buff will reset after drink has worn out).
- Buffs are always time related.
